\section*{INTRODUCTION :}
Disruption typically involves new market entrants creating products that bring in new consumers. But in healthcare, everyone is already a consumer. In healthcare, disruption often shifts care from hospitals to clinics and office settings, and even into patients' homes. 


Innovation is no stranger to the healthcare sector. ... Disruptive innovations are those that cause radical change and often result in new leaders in the field. They overturn the usual way of doing things to such an extent that they have a ripple effect throughout the industry.

\section*{Type Of Innovation In Health Care :}
 1. Incremental Innovation. Incremental can be perceived as continuous innovation. 
 
 
 2. Radical Innovation. Radical innovation is the opposite concept of Incremental innovation. 
 
 
 3.  Architectural Innovation. 
 
 
 4. Disruptive Innovation.
 
\section*{What is the most important innovation in healthcare?}

 1. Artificial intelligence.
 
 
 2. Cloud technology.
 
 
 3. Virtual ICU.
 
 
 4. Collaboration.
 
 
 5. Inpatient telehealth through specially equipped in-room televisions.
 
 
 6. Virtual Reality.
 
\section*{What is the Artificial Intelligence ?}
Artificial intelligence in healthcare is an overarching term used to describe the use of machine-learning algorithms and software, or artificial intelligence (AI), to mimic human cognition in the analysis, presentation, and comprehension of complex medical and health care data.

\section*{Disruptive technology :}
When the technology that has the potential for revolutionizing an industry emerges, established companies typically see it as unattractive: it’s not something their mainstream customers want, and its projected profit margins aren’t sufficient to cover big-company cost structure. As a result, the new technology tends to get ignored in favor of what’s currently popular with the best customers. But then another company steps in to bring the innovation to a new market.


Disruptive technology is an innovation that significantly alters the way that consumers, industries, or businesses operate.Disruptive technology is an innovation that significantly alters the way that consumers, industries, or businesses operate. A disruptive technology sweeps away the systems or habits it replaces because it has attributes that are recognizably superior.

\section*{Conclusion :}
Disruptive Innovation describes a process by which a product or service initially takes root in simple applications at the bottom of a market—typically by being less expensive and more accessible—and then relentlessly moves upmarket, eventually displacing established competitors.

The theory of disruptive innovation provides a generally useful warning about managerial myopia. Many of our experts noted examples of managers who overlooked or misunderstood the importance of an emerging threat.
